          <h2>Travel Worry-Free with Your Family</h2>

          <p>
            As a parent, it's next to impossible to fly if you have multiple kids.  Holding a baby while trying to carry 
            your own luggage, the baby's luggage, the toddler's luggage, the carseat, the stroller, etc. is 
            physically impossible. KidsFly alerts airport staff of your arrival to have an airport employee ready at the curb.
            By utilizing our services, your family will be able to travel without worrying about having to haul  
            bulky and heavy luggage and still keep track of your young ones.    
          </p>
          <p>
           Our friendly staff will meet you at your designated meeting point and do what is necessary or requested to 
           help you enjoy safe travels from airport to airport. 
          </p>
